Simon Game is a memory game. It consists of four different colors: red, green, yellow and blue. 
When the game starts, a button flashes and you have to press the button of the same color. Each time you have to keep in mind the colors given to you and click the buttons in the correct order from the first to the last color. 
After a while it is quite difficult to remember the colors in the sequence.
